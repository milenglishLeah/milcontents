<strong>Title: The Person Who I Inspire in the History</strong>

Many peoples we admire made it by bravery and leadership. George Washington is the first president who fought hard to win the revolutionary war. I admire George Washington because of his Great leadership and bravery.

First of all, George Washington had great leadership. leadership means he led people the right way during difficult times. For instance, Because of his leadership he become the first president of the united States. This is why, George Washington led American the right way.

Secondly, George Washington was brave. Bravery means doing something even though he is scared. If he had no bravery he can't do anything. For instance, in the Revolutionary War, even though Britain blockaded Boston harbor and Britain was much stronger he defeated by bravery. Thus, this event showed George Washingtons bravery.

To rap up, Because George Washington had bravery and leadership I admire him. George Washington led people the right way and he fought in the revolutionary war bravery. I hope one day I can be an extraordinary person like George Washinton in the future.

                    <span class="level level-intermediate">Intermediate (G3)</span>
                    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The student uses some strong topic-specific words like `revolutionary war` and `blockaded`.</p>
                    <p><strong>Growth Area:</strong> The vocabulary level is assessed as Intermediate because of the heavy repetition of key phrases like "led people the right way." To advance, the student must practice paraphrasing—finding different ways to express the same idea (e.g., "guided the nation," "provided strong direction").</p>

                    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The student can form basic sentences and uses end-of-sentence punctuation correctly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Growth Area:</strong> There are consistent errors in verb tenses (using "can't" for a past event) and sentence fragments (starting sentences with "Because"). Mastering past tense and ensuring every sentence is a complete thought are key next steps.</p>
                </div>

                    <span class="level level-proficient">Proficient (G4)</span>
                    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The essay includes clear topic sentences and transitions ("First of all," "Secondly"). This shows a strong understanding of paragraph structure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Growth Area:</strong> The sentence structure is sometimes repetitive. The presence of sentence fragments also indicates a developing skill level. The next step is to practice combining simple sentences to create more complex and varied structures.</p>

                    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The essay's logical organization is its best quality. The student clearly understands how to build an argument with a beginning, middle, and end.</p>
                    <p><strong>Growth Area:</strong> The essay is held back from a "Proficient" level by the combination of repetitive language and frequent mechanical errors. The primary focus must be on careful proofreading and expanding the variety of phrases used.</p>
