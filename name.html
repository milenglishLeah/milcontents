                Original Student Essay
            </h3>
            <div class="original-essay">
<strong>The person I admire the most in the history</strong>

One person can have a lot of power and change people's mind. King sejong is one of the greatest person who changed people's mind. King - Sejong was a King of Korea in Chosun and he is remembered by making hun-min-jung-um. I admire King sejong because he worked for commen people and made sience technology better.

To start with, I admire King Sejong because he worked for commen people. King Sejong wanted to make a better contury for poor people in Chosun. To illustrate, he made a Korean alphabet called hunmin-jungem because poor people can't read and write. There fore, King Sejong was a true and a good king for poor people in chosun.

Secondly, King made Science technology better. He was thinking that even making common people's alphabet, he thought making sience can make people live better. For instance, he took Jang yung Sil and made water, sun clock for the first time. therefore, king sejong is a person who connects science technology to now.

In conclusition, king sejong is who I admire due to his effort to poor people and his curiosity of sience to make people live better. King Sejong made Korean alphabet and invented sience and made people live better. I hope one day I want to be a heroic person who change the world like King - Sejong.

                    <span class="level level-proficient">Intermediate/Advanced (G4)</span>
                    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The student correctly uses high-level words like `admire`, `illustrate`, `curiosity`, and `heroic`, which shows a strong vocabulary base.</p>
                    <p><strong>Growth Area:</strong> There is some repetition of phrases like "live better" and "worked for common people." The next step is to practice paraphrasing these core ideas to show more vocabulary flexibility (e.g., using "improve the quality of life" or "dedicated to his citizens").</p>
                </div>

                    <span class="level level-intermediate">Intermediate (G3)</span>
                    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The student can form complex sentences and generally uses punctuation correctly to separate ideas.</p>
                    <p><strong>Growth Area:</strong> The main area for improvement is spelling. Consistent errors like `commen`, `sience`, and `contury` detract from the quality of the writing. Focusing on careful proofreading will fix this issue.</p>

                <div class="skill-card">
                    <h4>Sentence Structure</h4>
                    <span class="level level-advanced">Proficient (G4)</span>
                    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The sentence structure is a major strength. The student uses a variety of sentence beginnings and structures, including complex sentences. The use of clear topic sentences for each body paragraph is excellent.</p>
                    <p><strong>Growth Area:</strong> Some sentences are a bit long and could be slightly simplified for greater impact, but this is a minor point.</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="skill-card">
                    <h4>Overall Essay</h4>
                    <span class="level level-proficient">Proficient (G4)</span>
                    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The essay is logically structured, well-argued, and thoughtful. The personal connection in the conclusion is particularly effective.</p>
                    <p><strong>Growth Area:</strong> The primary factor holding the essay back from an "Advanced" rating is the frequency of basic spelling errors. Diligent proofreading is the key to elevating this already strong work.</p>

                Final Revised Essay
            </h3>
            <div class="final-essay">
                <strong>The Person I Admire Most in History: King Sejong</strong><br><br>
                A single individual can possess great power and influence the minds of many people. King Sejong is one of the greatest figures in Korean history who changed the way people think and live. As a celebrated king of the Chosun Dynasty, he is most remembered for his creation of Hunminjeongeum, the Korean alphabet. I admire King Sejong for two main reasons: his devotion to the common people and his advancements in science and technology.<br><br>
                First and foremost, I admire King Sejong for his dedication to serving the common people. His primary ambition was to create a better country for the underprivileged citizens of Chosun. To illustrate this, he invented the Korean alphabet so that commoners, who were previously illiterate, could finally learn to read and write. This incredible achievement shows that King Sejong was a truly compassionate leader who cared deeply for his people.<br><br>
                Secondly, King Sejong greatly advanced the fields of science and technology. He believed that alongside literacy, innovations in science were essential to improve the quality of life for everyone. For instance, he collaborated with the brilliant inventor Jang Yeong-sil to create revolutionary devices like the water clock and the sundial. Therefore, King Sejong's legacy in science and technology continues to connect with and influence us even today.<br><br>
                In conclusion, I admire King Sejong for his dedication to the common people and his use of scientific curiosity to improve their lives. By creating the Korean alphabet and promoting scientific inventions, he fundamentally improved his nation. I hope that I, too, can one day become a heroic figure who changes the world for the better, just like King Sejong.
